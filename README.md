# PyParser [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bahrom-matyakubov/PyParser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bahrom-matyakubov/PyParser) - Simple numeric expression parser and solver which replicates the behavior of eval with minimal usage of built-ins.
Trying to emulate Python 2.x ***eval*** whilst avoiding the usage of **find**, **rfind**, **enumerate** and all the other methods that we take for granted :coffee:
